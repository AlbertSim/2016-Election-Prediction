# 2016-Election-Prediction

In a college group of 3 people, we made a predictive models for the 2016 presidential election using 2010 census data. For one model, we used logistic regression (with LDA and QDA) and another model we used K-means clustering and decided which model was the best.

We used R and packages like tidyverse and randomForest.
